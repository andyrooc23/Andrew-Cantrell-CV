                <p> My name is Andrew cantrell and I am currently a 4th-Year Computer Science Major at California Baptist
                    University. I also love mathematics and thus am pursuing a minor in Mathematics on top of my major. My previous
                    work experience amounts to some development operations and internal software development experience at
                    Keysight Technologies.
                    I would love the opportunity to pursue a position where I can work alongside actual Software Engineers
                    developing real world code. I would love a perspective and view into the process of software development
                    while also sharpening my coding abilities with new information and potential new languages.</p>
                <p> I am an outgoing and team oriented individual who loves working with teams and alongside mentors. I am always
                    searching for newer and better ways of doing things and am always open to feedback and criticism. I have a lot of
                    experience working as both team member and team leader and would love the opportunity to prove myself.</p>
                <p> I am currently very proficient in java but as of the end of this semester will have completed coursework in
                    databases and a project based on raspberry pis and python. I would work diligently on all projects and push
                    myself to learn as much about the industry and software as possible. I specifically would love the opportunity
                    to work on any projects involving scripting languages as I have little experience in that field and am
                    starting to love python.</p>
                <p>Thank you again for the consideration of my employment,</p>
                <p>-Andrew Cantrell</p>
